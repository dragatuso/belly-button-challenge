# belly-button-challenge
The repository includes the index.html file, the samples.json file (only including the sample of the data), and a static folder with the app.js file that includes the code. Most of the code was based on the exercises reviewed and completed in class. However, for this challenge I also did a lot of research online, mainly in the relevant documentation and in stack overflow. I have also used Copilot to correct part of te code.

The link to the app is https://dragatuso.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
